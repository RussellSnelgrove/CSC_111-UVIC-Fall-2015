   This function is already complete.

	- Open the input file WIREFRAME_INPUT_FILENAME (defined at the top of this file),
	  which contains the data for a wireframe model.

	- Open the output file HTML5_SVG_OUTPUT_FILENAME (also defined at the top of this
	  file), which will contain the output HTML code.

	- Call the writePrologue function to write the HTML prologue to the output file.

	- For each 3d line segment in the input file:
		- Convert the 3d line segment to a 2d line segment
		- Write the 2d line segment to the output file

	- Call the writeEpilogue function to write the HTML epilogue to the output file.

	- Close the input and output files.
